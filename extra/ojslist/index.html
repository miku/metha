<h3>Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h3>

<p>Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conferences (IAAI) traditionally consist of of case studies of deployed applications with measurable benefits whose value depends on the use of AI technology. In addition, many IAAI conferences augment these case studies with papers and invited talks that address emerging areas of AI technology or applications. IAAI is organized as an independent program within the AAAI Conference, with schedules coordinated to allow attendees to move freely between IAAI and AAAI Conference sessions. IAAI and the AAAI Conference often jointly sponsor invited talks that fit the theme of both programs.</p>

<h3>AAAI Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence</h3>

<p>The AAAI Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence provides a venue for researchers and educators to discuss pedagogical issues and share resources related to teaching AI and using AI in education across a variety of curricular levels (K-12 through postgraduate training), with a natural emphasis on undergraduate and graduate teaching and learning. The symposium seeks contributions showing how to more effectively teach AI, as well as how themes from AI may be used to enhance education more broadly; for example in introductory computing courses or as a means for teaching computational thinking. We encourge the sharing of innovative educational approaches that convey or leverage AI and its many subfields, such as robotics, machine learning, natural language, computer vision, and so on.</p>

<h3>International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling</h3>

<p>The International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners in planning and scheduling - two technologies that are critical to manufacturing, space systems, software engineering, robotics, education, and entertainment. The ICAPS conference resulted from merging two bi-annual conferences, namely the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Planning and Scheduling (AIPS) and the European Conference on Planning (ECP). The primary objectives of ICAPS are to further the field of automated planning and scheduling through the organization of technical meetings, including the annual ICAPS conference, through the organization of summer schools, tutorials and training activities at various events, through the organization of planning and scheduling competitions, benchmarking and other means of advancing and assessing the state of the art in the field, by promoting the involvement of young scientists in the field through scholarships and other means, and by promoting and disseminating publications, planning and scheduling systems, domains, simulators, software tools and technical material.</p>

<h3>International Conference on Computational Cultural Dynamics</h3>

<p><div>Computer technology is leading to sweeping changes in how we can reason about groups in diverse cultures. Examples include computer systems to aid researchers in gathering data about different cultural groups, learning the intensity of opinions that those groups have on various topics, building/extracting models of behavior of those groups, and continuously refining those behaviors through shared, multiperson, learning experiences.</div><div><br /></div><div>These developments are inherently cross-disciplinary. They blend the behavioral and social sciences&mdash;fields such as political science, psychology, journalism, anthropology, and sociology&mdash;with technological fields such as computer science, computational linguistics, game theory, and operations research.</div><div><br /></div><div>Currently, many of these research communities are largely unconnected. There is a need to bring them together to help forge a common understanding of principles, techniques, and application areas. That is the purpose of this conference.&nbsp;</div></p>

<h3>International Symposium on Combinatorial Search</h3>

<p>Heuristic search and combinatorial optimization are currently very active areas of research. For example, researchers investigate how to search in real-time, how to search with limited (possibly external) memory, how to solve sequences of similar search problems faster than with isolated searches, how to improve the runtime of the searches over time, how to trade-off between the runtime and memory consumption of the search and the resulting solution quality, and how to focus the searches with sophisticated heuristics such as pattern databases. Their results are published in different conferences such as IJCAI, AAAI, ICAPS, NIPS, ICRA, and IROS. The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) is meant to bring these researchers together to exchange their ideas and cross-fertilize the field. Thus, in addition to seeking separate answers to questions like how to design more accurate memory-based heuristics, more I/O-efficient disk-based search algorithms, or more efficient clause-learning strategies, the symposium will stimulate thoughts on combining various techniques originated from different areas of search.</p>
