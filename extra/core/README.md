# CORE

In 09/2020 [CORE provides access](https://core.ac.uk/data/) to:

* 200810541 metadata items
* 24936921 PDFs

> It's the biggest collection of open access full texts, making it an
> unparalleled research tool. It's over 45 terabytes (TB) of textual data.

> We're truly global, aggregating from 10,222 data providers, in 146 countries.

Pity, I cannot find a simple list (like [this](https://git.io/vKXFv)) of these
10222 providers.
